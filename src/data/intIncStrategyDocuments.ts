## ⚠ Critical Risk: Microsoft Licensing Changes

**As of November 1, 2025, Microsoft eliminated ALL volume discounts** for Online Services (M365, Azure, Dynamics 365). Renewals after this date pay full list price regardless of org size.

**Action required:** Review EA renewal date immediately; model costs at list price.

---

## The Bottom Line

**INT Inc is well-positioned to lead in AI-augmented managed services.** With 25+ years of trusted partnerships and SOC 2 Type II certification, the foundation exists.

**The question isn't whether to adopt AI — it's how fast competitors will move first.**

**Next Step:** Schedule 30-minute pilot program briefing with stakeholders.`,

## "Hybrid Intelligence" Model

### Diversifying AI Tools to Reclaim 15-22% Team Productivity

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### The Opportunity

INT Inc. has built a strong foundation with Microsoft 365 and Copilot for internal data security and searchability. However, 70% of Fortune 500 companies now deploy AI, and 87% of MSPs report significant AI knowledge gaps. The competitive window is 6-18 months before AI becomes table stakes.

### The Capability Gap

While Copilot excels as a **Librarian** (searching and organizing internal data), it isn't always the best **Analyst** or **Coder**. Competitors using specialized tools like Perplexity for real-time market research or Claude for complex code generation are moving faster.

### The Solution: Hybrid Intelligence

- **Microsoft Copilot:** Internal data (SharePoint, Teams, Outlook) - the secure foundation
- **Claude Enterprise:** Complex reasoning, technical documentation, code review
- **Perplexity Pro:** Real-time research, vendor intelligence, market analysis
- **ChatGPT/Gemini:** Creative content, client communications, specialized workflows

### The Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Year 1 Investment | $50K-$75K |
| Projected Time Savings | 15-22% productivity gains |
| 3-Year ROI | 626% (Hybrid Model) |

## 2. The Elevator Pitch Script

### Opening (30 seconds)

"Good morning/afternoon. Thank you for the time.

We all know AI is shifting the landscape. Right now, INT Inc. has a strong foundation with Microsoft 365 and Copilot. It's excellent for keeping our internal data secure and searchable."

### The Problem (45 seconds)

"However, as I've been digging into our workflows across the company, I've noticed a 'Capability Gap.' While Copilot is a great Librarian, it isn't always the best Analyst or Coder.

Competitors who are using tools like Perplexity for real-time market research, or Claude for complex code generation, are moving faster than us. They are getting answers in seconds that take us minutes or hours."

### The Solution (30 seconds)

"My goal today isn't to replace Copilot—it's to diversify our toolkit. I want to show you how a low-cost, high-security pilot program can help us reclaim about 15% of our team's time for higher-value work.

Let's look at the numbers."

### Key Phrases to Emphasize

- **"Diversify our toolkit"** — Not replacing, adding options
- **"Capability Gap"** — Technical term that sounds strategic
- **"Librarian vs. Analyst"** — Memorable metaphor
- **"Low-cost, high-security"** — Addresses two biggest concerns upfront

---

## 3. Objection Battle Card

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already have Copilot" | "Copilot is our foundation. We're proposing specialized tools for tasks where it underperforms, not replacement." |
| "Too expensive" | "At $50K Year 1, we project 626% ROI. The cost of NOT adopting is falling behind competitors." |
| "Security concerns" | "Claude and Perplexity both offer SOC 2 Type II compliance. We'd start with non-sensitive data only." |
| "Too many tools" | "Fair concern. We're proposing a controlled 30-day pilot with 5 users before any broad rollout." |
| "We're not ready" | "That's exactly why we start with assessment. The 90-day roadmap begins with readiness evaluation." |

## 2. The Elevator Pitch Script

*Use this script when you stand up to present Slide 1. It establishes you as a forward-thinking partner, not just a complainer.*

---

## 3. Objection Battle Card

*Executives will interrupt you. Here are the top objections and exactly how to respond without sounding defensive.*

### OBJECTION 1: "We already pay for Copilot. Why should we pay for more tools?"

**Your Response:**

"That's a great point on cost. Think of Copilot like a General Practitioner doctor—essential for general health. But sometimes you need a Specialist.

For complex coding or deep market research, Copilot often hallucinates or gets stuck. For just $20/month, a 'Specialist' tool like Claude can save an engineer 5 hours. The ROI on that $20 is instant."

**Key Data Point:** Claude Pro at $20/month = 5 hours saved per engineer = $250+ value at $50/hr loaded cost

### OBJECTION 2: "I'm worried about security. I don't want company data on Google or Anthropic servers."

**Your Response:**

"I agree 100%. That is why the Data Triage Matrix is the core of this proposal.

We are strictly prohibiting Client PII in these new tools. We will only use them for non-sensitive tasks like code syntax, public market research, and generic drafting. Secure data stays in Microsoft. Speed goes to the others."

**Key Data Point:** All recommended platforms (Claude, Perplexity) have SOC 2 Type II certification and zero data retention policies

### OBJECTION 3: "This sounds complicated to manage. We don't want Shadow IT."

**Your Response:**

"Actually, 'Shadow IT' is happening right now. People are likely using personal ChatGPT accounts because they need the help.

By sanctioning a Pilot Program, we bring that activity into the light, govern it, and actually see what works. It gives us control back, rather than losing it."

**Key Data Point:** Industry surveys show 60-70% of employees use unauthorized AI tools. Sanctioned pilots reduce risk.

---

## 4. Data Triage Matrix

*This is the governance framework that makes the proposal possible. It addresses security concerns by clearly defining what data goes where.*

| Data Type | Platform | Security Level | Examples |
|-----------|----------|----------------|----------|
| Client PII | Microsoft ONLY | RESTRICTED | SSN, financials, health data |
| Internal Docs | Microsoft + Claude | CONFIDENTIAL | SOPs, runbooks, policies |
| Code/Technical | Claude + ChatGPT | STANDARD | PowerShell, Python, configs |
| Market Research | Perplexity + Gemini | PUBLIC | Vendor intel, industry trends |
| Creative Content | ChatGPT + Gemini | PUBLIC | Blog drafts, social, emails |

**The Core Principle:** SECURE DATA stays in Microsoft. SPEED goes to the specialists.

### EXECUTIVE BRIEFING: AI Toolkit Diversification Proposal

**The Problem**

Over-reliance on a single AI vendor (Microsoft) creates blind spots in research and coding efficiency. While Copilot excels at internal data retrieval, it underperforms in real-time market research, complex reasoning tasks, and specialized code generation. Competitors leveraging multi-platform AI strategies are achieving 20-40% faster delivery times.

**The Solution**

A "Hybrid Intelligence" model using complementary AI tools:
- **Microsoft Copilot (Internal):** Secure data, M365 integration, SharePoint search
- **Perplexity (Research):** Real-time market intelligence, vendor analysis, competitive research
- **Claude (Reasoning):** Complex documentation, code review, compliance analysis

**The Pilot**

A proposed 30-day test with 5 users across IT, InfoSec, and Marketing to measure efficiency gains. Metrics include time-to-resolution, documentation quality scores, and user satisfaction ratings.

**The Ask**

1. Approval for a $500 pilot budget (5 licenses × $20/month × 5 months)
2. Provisional policy update to allow approved AI tools for non-PII tasks
3. 30-day review checkpoint to assess ROI and expand or terminate

**Expected Outcomes**

- 15-22% productivity improvement in pilot departments
- Validated use cases for company-wide rollout
- Reduced Shadow IT risk through sanctioned tool usage
- Foundation for AI Your BI℠ service enhancement
